# Shiny-Visualiztion-Project
R-code for the project
The Goal of this Project is to compare the data for three main economic sectors in Texas since 2007 in order to see which ones are the most volatile, and which ones are more effected by recessions or general economic trends. From this, we can see that Maufacturing is the most consistent throughout most of the indexes and time periods which tracks with what I suspected to be thet case. This data is useful in also showing what type of worker and company are the most effected by recessions and also by the Covid pandemic, as some of the trackers are hours worked, which are good for tracking how much is actually being done at jobs. Another important note is that all the data was seasonally adjusted, which might effect the numbers of certain industries that are more affected by seasonal trends.
